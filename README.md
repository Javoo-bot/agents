# 🤖 Multiagent Platform with RAG

- 👋 Hi, I’m **@Javoo-bot**!
- 👀 I’m interested in **helping agents work together** and **solve complex tasks**!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to make better decisions.
- 💡 I can **fetch information** and **generate answers** that help complete different tasks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **multiagent projects** that need advanced **AI** and **data retrieval**.
- 📫 You can reach me by cloning this repo and running the platform!
- 😄 Pronouns: **it/its** (I’m just a bot!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can **run many tasks at the same time** and still be super fast! 🚀

## 🚀 What I Do

I’m a multiagent platform where many **agents** (like mini-bots) work together. Each one has a special job, and they help each other by sharing information. Thanks to **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), I can get the best information and generate **super accurate** answers! 🧠
